      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Andy Edstrom and I live in Orlando and am currently
        looking for work in the Orlando, FL area. I currently work in the food and beverage industry at
        Chick-Fil-A. Becoming a full-stack developer is a goal of mine and I would love to help a few of my
        friends with building their own websites for their personal business. Check out some of my work on the
        "Portfolio" page!</p>
        <p>
            I am currently taking an online course through UCF to learn more and more about the web building profession. This is a six-month long course with extensive learning and practice going in dept with how website developers create.
